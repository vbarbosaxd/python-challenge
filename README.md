# Python Challenge Overview
Used various basic python concepts to analyze the financial records of a company (PyBank) and to find the election results of a small town (PyPoll).

## PyBank
I created a python script that analyzed a CSV file containing the financial records of a fictional company and was able to find the number of months contained within the dataset. I was also able to find the total amount of profit/losses during that time period, as well as calculate the average change. Finally, I was able to locate the greatest increase in profit, as well as the greatest decrease in profit, each with their respective months.

## PyPoll
I was able to create a python script that would iterate through a CSV file and output the total number of votes that were casted in an election. I was also able to find the number of votes casted for each candidate, as well as the winner of the election.
